# cloudash

Cloudash is an opensource cloud web panel/dashboard abstracting lower level IaaS infrastructures.

* DigitalOcean'ish feeling on top of a lower level IaaS. (supporting OpenNebula)
* Multi tenant with independent resources plans.
* Built-in optional ticketing system.
* Action logging system.
* VM ownership.
* Feature rich VM. (metrics, console, editable resources and network)

## Requirements

* MongoDB
* Nodejs
* OpenNebula

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/no-limit-network/cloudash`
* `cd cloudash`
* `mv config.js.example config.js`
* `vi config.js`
* `node install.js`
* `node main.js`

## SSL (optional)

Easiest and cleanest way to use SSL is using `nginx` as a reverse proxy in front of cloudash.

Example `nginx` conf file.
```
server {
  listen   443 ssl;
  server_name ~^(.+)$;

  location / {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;

    ssl_certificate     /var/cert/ssl.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /var/cert/ssl.key;
  }
}
```
